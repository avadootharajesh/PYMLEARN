📌 What is a Product Recommendation Engine?
A system that suggests relevant products to customers based on their behavior, preferences, and similarities with other users or items

Helps increase engagement, sales, and customer satisfaction

🔍 Types of Recommendation Systems
Collaborative Filtering

Uses user-item interaction data (ratings, purchases)

User-based or item-based similarity

Content-Based Filtering

Uses product attributes and user profiles to recommend similar items

Hybrid Systems

Combine both approaches for better accuracy

⚙️ Typical Workflow
Data Collection: User purchase history, ratings, product metadata

Data Preprocessing: Clean and format data

Similarity Computation: Calculate user or item similarity (cosine similarity, Pearson correlation)

Model Building: Generate recommendations based on nearest neighbors or matrix factorization

Evaluation: Metrics like precision, recall, MAP, RMSE for rating prediction

Deployment: Integrate into e-commerce platform for real-time recommendations

🧰 Common Tools & Libraries
pandas, numpy for data handling

scikit-learn for similarity calculations

surprise library for collaborative filtering algorithms

lightfm for hybrid recommendation

flask or fastapi for API deployment
