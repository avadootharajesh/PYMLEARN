News_Article_Topic_Classification_System notes
📌 What is News Article Topic Classification?
It’s an automated system to categorize news articles into predefined topics or categories

Helps organize, filter, and recommend news content based on subjects like politics, sports, technology, business, etc.

🔍 How It Works
Data Collection:

Gather labeled news articles with topics (e.g., “Politics,” “Sports,” “Technology”)

Data Preprocessing:

Clean text (remove punctuation, stopwords), tokenize, and convert to numerical features (TF-IDF, word embeddings)

Feature Extraction:

Convert text into features usable by ML models (CountVectorizer, TF-IDF, or pretrained embeddings)

Model Building:

Train classification models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, or deep learning)

Evaluation:

Assess with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

Deployment:

Integrate with news portals or apps for real-time topic classification

⚙️ Typical Workflow
Load dataset (e.g., 20 Newsgroups, BBC news dataset)

Clean and preprocess text

Vectorize text with TF-IDF or embeddings

Split train/test

Train and evaluate classifier

Predict categories on new articles

🧰 Common Tools & Libraries
Text processing: nltk, spacy

Feature extraction: scikit-learn (CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer)

Classification models: scikit-learn (LogisticRegression, MultinomialNB, SVC)

Deep learning: transformers for BERT-based classification

Evaluation: scikit-learn metrics
