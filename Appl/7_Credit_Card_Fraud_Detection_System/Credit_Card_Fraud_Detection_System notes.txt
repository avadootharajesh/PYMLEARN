Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection_System notes
📌 What is Credit Card Fraud Detection?
Automated detection of unauthorized or fraudulent credit card transactions

Protects customers and financial institutions from losses

🔍 How It Works
Uses transaction data: amount, location, time, merchant, etc.

Employs supervised or unsupervised learning to identify anomalies

Common challenges include extreme class imbalance and evolving fraud tactics

⚙️ Typical Workflow
Data Collection: Historical transaction records labeled as fraud or genuine

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing data, normalize features

Feature Engineering: Time-based features, transaction frequency, amount patterns

Model Training: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Isolation Forest (for anomaly detection)

Evaluation: Precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, focusing on catching fraud while minimizing false alarms

Deployment: Real-time scoring systems integrated with transaction processing

🧰 Common Datasets
Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset (highly imbalanced)
