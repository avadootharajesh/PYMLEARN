Traffic_Signs_Recognition_App notes
üìå What is Traffic Signs Recognition?
Automatically detecting and classifying traffic signs from images or video

Critical for autonomous driving, driver assistance systems, and smart traffic management

üîç How It Works
Data Collection: Images of traffic signs from datasets like GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark)

Preprocessing: Resize images, normalize pixel values

Model Training: Train CNN classifiers to recognize different traffic sign categories

Prediction: Input new images or frames, predict sign type

Integration: Embed in apps or vehicles for real-time sign recognition

‚öôÔ∏è Typical Workflow
Download and preprocess traffic signs dataset (e.g., GTSRB)

Train CNN model on labeled traffic sign images

Test model accuracy on validation data

Build app interface to upload or capture sign images

Show predicted traffic sign class and confidence

üß∞ Common Tools & Libraries
Deep learning: tensorflow, keras, pytorch

Image processing: opencv-python, PIL

Dataset: GTSRB (available publicly)

Web/App frameworks: Streamlit, Flask
