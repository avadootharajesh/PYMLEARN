📌 What is Regression?
Regression is a type of supervised learning used to predict a continuous numerical value based on input features.

🎯 Common Use Cases
Predicting house prices

Estimating sales revenue

Forecasting stock prices

Modeling medical costs

🧠 Popular Regression Algorithms
Algorithm	Description
Linear Regression	Basic straight-line fit using least squares
Ridge & Lasso Regression	Regularized versions to prevent overfitting
Polynomial Regression	Captures non-linear relationships
Decision Tree Regressor	Tree splits for numerical prediction
Random Forest Regressor	Ensemble of regression trees
Gradient Boosting / XGBoost	High-performance boosting models
K-Nearest Neighbors	Predicts based on average of nearest neighbors
Support Vector Regressor (SVR)	Uses margins to predict continuous values

⚙️ Key Steps in Regression
Load and explore the data

Handle missing values and outliers

Feature scaling if needed

Train/test split

Model fitting

Evaluate performance

📈 Evaluation Metrics
Metric	Description
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)	Average of absolute errors
Mean Squared Error (MSE)	Average of squared errors
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)	Square root of MSE
R² Score (R-Squared)	Variance explained by the model
