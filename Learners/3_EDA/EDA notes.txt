ðŸ“Œ What is EDA?
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often using visual methods. It helps you understand:

What data youâ€™re working with

What patterns and relationships exist

What problems (like outliers, errors, or biases) may be present

ðŸ§° Core EDA Steps
1. Understand the Dataset Structure
Shape of data (df.shape)

Column types (df.dtypes)

Sample rows (df.head() / df.tail())

2. Summary Statistics
Central tendency (mean, median)

Spread (standard deviation, variance, IQR)

Using df.describe()

3. Missing Values Check
Count missing values per column

Visualize missingness using libraries like missingno

4. Univariate Analysis
Distribution of individual variables

For numerical: histograms, boxplots, KDE plots

For categorical: bar plots, value counts

5. Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis
Relationships between features

Scatter plots, pair plots, correlation matrix

Group-based aggregations (groupby())

6. Outlier Detection
Boxplots

Z-score, IQR-based filtering

7. Correlation Analysis
Pearson/Spearman correlation

Visualized via heatmap

8. Target Variable Distribution (if supervised learning)
Class imbalance check (for classification)

Distribution of target values

ðŸ“Š Visualization Tools
matplotlib

seaborn

pandas.plot()

missingno

ðŸ§  Why is EDA Important?
Reveals structure, patterns, and anomalies

Informs data cleaning and preprocessing

Aids in selecting features and models

Essential for avoiding bad assumptions
