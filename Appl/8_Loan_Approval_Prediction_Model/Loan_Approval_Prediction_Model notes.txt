Loan_Approval_Prediction_Model notes
üìå What is Loan Approval Prediction?
Predicting whether a loan application should be approved or rejected

Based on applicant‚Äôs profile: income, credit history, employment, loan amount, etc.

Helps financial institutions automate and improve decision making

üîç How It Works
Use historical loan application data labeled as approved/rejected

Data preprocessing: handle missing values, encode categorical variables

Feature engineering: debt-to-income ratio, credit score bins, etc.

Train classification models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost

Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

‚öôÔ∏è Typical Workflow
Data Collection: Loan application datasets (e.g., from banks or Kaggle)

Data Cleaning: Impute missing values, remove outliers

Feature Engineering: Create meaningful variables from raw data

Modeling: Train classifiers on processed data

Evaluation: Check confusion matrix and other metrics for balanced performance

Deployment: Integrate with loan management systems

üß∞ Common Features
