Text_Summarization_Tool notes
üìå What is Text Summarization?
Automatic process of creating a concise and coherent summary from a longer text document

Two main types:

Extractive summarization: Selects important sentences/phrases directly from the text

Abstractive summarization: Generates new sentences capturing the core meaning (like human-written summary)

üîç How It Works
Input Text:

Takes long articles, reports, or documents as input

Text Preprocessing:

Tokenization, stopword removal, sentence segmentation

Summarization Techniques:

Extractive: Score sentences by importance (TF-IDF, TextRank, LexRank) and select top ones

Abstractive: Use deep learning models (Transformers like BART, T5) to generate summary

Output Summary:

Shortened text retaining key information and context

‚öôÔ∏è Typical Workflow
Load and preprocess text

For extractive: rank sentences and pick top N sentences

For abstractive: pass text to pretrained transformer summarization model

Return or display summary

üß∞ Common Tools & Libraries
NLP: nltk, spacy (for preprocessing)

Extractive summarization: sumy, networkx (for TextRank)

Abstractive summarization: transformers (Hugging Face)

Utilities: torch, tensorflow
