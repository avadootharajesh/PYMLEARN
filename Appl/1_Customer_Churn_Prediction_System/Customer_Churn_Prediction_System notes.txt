Customer_Churn_Prediction_System notes
üìå What is Customer Churn?
When customers stop using a company‚Äôs product or service

Measured as a churn rate (percentage of customers lost over time)

High churn is costly; predicting churn enables proactive retention strategies

üîç Why Predict Churn?
Reduce customer acquisition cost by focusing on retention

Identify risk factors causing churn

Personalize offers or interventions for at-risk customers

Improve overall customer satisfaction and lifetime value

‚öôÔ∏è Typical Workflow
Data Collection: Customer demographics, account info, service usage, support calls, billing data

Exploratory Data Analysis: Understand data distributions, identify key features

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, normalize data

Feature Engineering: Create derived features like tenure, usage patterns, complaints count

Model Selection & Training: Common algorithms ‚Äî Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks

Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

Deployment: Create API or dashboard for real-time churn prediction

Actionable Insights: Identify top factors influencing churn (feature importance, SHAP)

üß∞ Common Features Used
Customer demographics (age, gender)

Account info (contract type, tenure, payment method)

Usage metrics (monthly charges, call minutes)

Customer support interactions

Previous churn history (if any)

Challenges
Imbalanced datasets (fewer churn cases)

Data quality and missing values

Concept drift over time (changing customer behavior)
