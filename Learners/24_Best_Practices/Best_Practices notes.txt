# Best_Practices notes.txt
📌 Why Best Practices?

Improve code quality, readability, and collaboration
Ensure reproducibility and reliability
Make projects scalable and easier to maintain
Reduce bugs and technical debt
Facilitate deployment and monitoring

🗂️ Project Structure & Organization
Use modular code: separate data processing, modeling, evaluation, and utilities
Organize code in folders (e.g., /data, /notebooks, /scripts, /models)
Use version control (Git) for code and experiment tracking
Document code with docstrings and comments
Write readme files to explain project goals, setup, and usage

🔢 Data Management
Keep raw data immutable; work on copies or pipelines
Use data versioning tools (e.g., DVC) for datasets and features
Clean and preprocess data consistently with automated pipelines
Handle missing values thoughtfully, avoid data leakage
Validate data quality regularly

🧠 Modeling Practices
Split data properly: train/validation/test sets
Avoid data leakage at all stages
Use cross-validation for robust evaluation
Track experiments with metrics and hyperparameters (e.g., MLflow)
Use interpretable models or explainability methods when needed

🧪 Code Quality & Testing
Follow PEP8 coding standards (Python)
Write unit tests for functions and modules
Use linters like flake8 or black for code formatting
Automate testing and CI/CD pipelines for reproducibility

🚀 Deployment & Monitoring
Containerize applications (Docker) for reproducibility
Use API frameworks (Flask, FastAPI) for serving models
Monitor model performance and data drift in production
Implement logging and error handling
Automate retraining and updates with pipelines

🔐 Security & Ethics
Secure sensitive data (encryption, access control)
Avoid biased data and models — audit fairness regularly
Follow regulatory requirements (GDPR, HIPAA)
Be transparent about model limitations

Notes:
Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
Use descriptive names and docstrings
Separate data loading, cleaning, modeling into modules
Write tests to catch errors early
Use version control and virtual environments
