Mental_Health_Chatbot_using_NLP notes
📌 What is a Mental Health Chatbot?
An AI-powered conversational agent designed to provide emotional support, basic counseling, and resources related to mental health

Can help users talk about their feelings, reduce anxiety, and suggest coping strategies

Not a replacement for professional therapy but a supportive tool accessible anytime

🔍 How It Works
Input: User types messages describing feelings, problems, or questions

NLP Processing:

Text preprocessing: tokenization, cleaning

Intent recognition and sentiment analysis to understand user mood and needs

Response Generation:

Rule-based replies for common phrases (e.g., “I feel sad”)

Retrieval-based or generative models for richer conversations

Provide empathetic, supportive, and helpful responses

Resource Sharing: Links to mental health resources, hotlines, or coping tips

⚙️ Typical Workflow
Prepare dataset of mental health-related conversations or use prebuilt intent libraries

Build NLP pipeline: sentiment analysis + intent classification

Implement response system (rule-based or ML-based)

Create chatbot interface (CLI, web app, or messaging platform integration)

🧰 Common Tools & Libraries
NLP: nltk, spaCy, transformers (HuggingFace)

Sentiment Analysis: pretrained models (e.g., distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english)

Chatbot frameworks: Rasa, ChatterBot (simple)

Web/UI: streamlit, flask
