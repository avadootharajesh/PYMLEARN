Employee_Attrition_Prediction_System notes
üìå What is Employee Attrition Prediction?
It‚Äôs a predictive analytics system to identify employees likely to leave the organization (attrition)

Helps HR proactively retain talent by understanding factors contributing to attrition

Uses historical employee data including demographics, job role, satisfaction, performance, etc.

üîç How It Works
Data Collection:

Features like age, gender, department, job role, tenure, salary, job satisfaction, work-life balance, promotion history, etc.

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing data, encode categorical variables, scale features

Model Building:

Classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) predict attrition (Yes/No)

Evaluation:

Use metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

Interpretation:

Identify key factors influencing attrition (feature importance)

Deployment:

Integrate into HR dashboards for monitoring and decision-making

‚öôÔ∏è Typical Workflow
Load and preprocess dataset (e.g., IBM HR Analytics Attrition dataset)

Split data into train/test sets

Train classification models and tune hyperparameters

Evaluate and select best performing model

Deploy model to predict attrition on new employee data

üß∞ Common Tools & Libraries
Data handling: pandas, numpy

ML models: scikit-learn, xgboost
