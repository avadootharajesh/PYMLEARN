# Recommendation_Systems notes.txt
📌 What is a Recommendation System?
A system that suggests items (products, movies, music, etc.) to users based on their preferences, behaviors, or item characteristics.

🔍 Types of Recommendation Systems
| Type                        | Description                                     | Examples                   |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Content-Based Filtering** | Recommends items similar to those a user liked  | Based on item features     |
| **Collaborative Filtering** | Recommends items liked by similar users         | User-item interaction data |
| **Hybrid**                  | Combines both content and collaborative methods | Netflix, Amazon            |


⚙️ Core Components
User-Item Interaction Matrix: Typically sparse (users vs items)

Similarity Measures: Cosine similarity, Pearson correlation

Dimensionality Reduction: SVD, PCA for latent factors

Algorithms: k-NN, matrix factorization, deep learning models

🧰 Common Libraries
surprise — easy collaborative filtering

implicit — fast implicit feedback recommender

scikit-learn — basic nearest neighbor methods

lightfm — hybrid models with content + collaborative

📝 Challenges
Cold start problem (new users/items)

Data sparsity

Scalability with large datasets

Evaluation metrics: Precision@k, Recall@k, MAP, RMSE
