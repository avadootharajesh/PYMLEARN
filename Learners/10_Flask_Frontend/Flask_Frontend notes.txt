📌 What’s the goal?
Provide a user-friendly HTML form to input ML features

Submit data to backend endpoint (the same Flask app or separate API)

Display predictions and results dynamically on a webpage

⚙️ How it works:
Flask renders a form at / via GET

On form submission (POST), Flask collects inputs

Flask calls the ML model prediction function (or internal API)

Shows prediction result on the same or a results page

Why build this?
Makes your ML model accessible to non-technical users

Great for demos, prototypes, or quick validations

Easily extendable with JS, styling, or other APIs
