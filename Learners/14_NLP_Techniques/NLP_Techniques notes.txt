| Task                               | Description                        | Common Techniques                                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Text Preprocessing**             | Cleaning and normalizing text      | Tokenization, lowercasing, stopword removal, stemming, lemmatization |
| **Text Representation**            | Convert text to numerical features | Bag of Words, TF-IDF, Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText)    |
| **Language Modeling**              | Predict next word/token            | n-grams, RNNs, Transformers (BERT, GPT)                              |
| **Text Classification**            | Categorize text documents          | Logistic Regression, SVM, deep learning (CNN, LSTM)                  |
| **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** | Extract entities from text         | Conditional Random Fields, Transformers                              |
| **Sentiment Analysis**             | Determine sentiment polarity       | Lexicon-based or supervised ML models                                |
| **Machine Translation**            | Translate text between languages   | Sequence-to-sequence models, Transformers                            |
| **Topic Modeling**                 | Discover topics in text corpus     | LDA, NMF                                                             |
