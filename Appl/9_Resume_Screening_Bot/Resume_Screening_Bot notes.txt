Resume_Screening_Bot notes
üìå What is a Resume Screening Bot?
An automated system that parses resumes and evaluates candidates based on job requirements

Saves recruiters time by filtering out unqualified candidates early

Often uses NLP techniques to extract skills, experience, education, and match with job criteria

üîç How It Works
Resume Parsing: Extract text and structured info from PDF, DOCX, or TXT resumes

Text Preprocessing: Clean and tokenize extracted text

Feature Extraction: Identify keywords, skills, years of experience, education level

Matching & Scoring: Compare candidate profile to job requirements using similarity metrics or classifiers

Ranking: Rank resumes by relevance score for recruiters

‚öôÔ∏è Typical Workflow
Input: Collection of resumes + job description

Parsing: Use libraries like PyPDF2, pdfminer, docx, or resume-specific parsers

NLP Processing: Extract key entities (skills, experience) using regex, NLP libraries or pretrained models

Matching: Vectorize job description and resumes using TF-IDF or embeddings, compute similarity

Output: List of top matching resumes or a decision (accept/reject)

üß∞ Tools & Libraries
PyPDF2, pdfminer.six for PDF parsing

python-docx for DOCX files

spaCy, NLTK for NLP

scikit-learn for vectorization and similarity

Optional: pretrained transformer models like BERT for semantic matching
