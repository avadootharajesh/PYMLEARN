Facial_Emotion_Detection_System notes
üìå What is Facial Emotion Detection?
Automatically identifying human emotions (like happy, sad, angry, surprise, etc.) from facial expressions captured via images or video

Used in marketing, healthcare, security, and human-computer interaction

üîç How It Works
Face Detection: Locate faces in images/videos using detectors like Haar Cascades, HOG + SVM, or deep learning models (MTCNN, SSD)

Preprocessing: Crop and normalize face region

Feature Extraction: Use CNNs or pretrained models to extract facial features

Emotion Classification: Classify features into emotion categories using deep learning classifiers

Output: Emotion label with confidence score, sometimes with visual overlay

‚öôÔ∏è Typical Workflow
Collect and preprocess labeled face images with emotion annotations (datasets like FER2013, CK+)

Train CNN or fine-tune pretrained models (e.g., VGGFace, ResNet) for emotion classification

Use face detection for input images/video frames

Apply trained classifier to detected faces

Visualize emotions with bounding boxes and labels

üß∞ Common Tools & Libraries
Face detection: opencv-python (Haar Cascades), dlib, mtcnn

Deep learning: tensorflow, keras, pytorch

Datasets: FER2013, CK+, AffectNet

Visualization: matplotlib, opencv drawing functions
