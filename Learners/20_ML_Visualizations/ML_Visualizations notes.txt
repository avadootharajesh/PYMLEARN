# ML_Visualizations notes.txt
üìå What are ML Visualizations?
Graphical representations that help understand data distributions, relationships, model behavior, and performance.

üîç Common Visualization Types
Visualization Type	Purpose	Examples/Tools
Data Exploration	Understand raw data distribution & patterns	Histograms, Boxplots, Scatter plots (matplotlib, seaborn)
Feature Relationships	Show correlations and interactions	Pairplots, Heatmaps, Correlation matrices
Model Performance	Evaluate models and tune parameters	ROC Curve, Precision-Recall Curve, Confusion Matrix
Model Interpretability	Explain model decisions	SHAP, LIME, Partial Dependence Plots
Training Process	Monitor training dynamics	Loss curves, Accuracy curves

‚öôÔ∏è Popular Visualization Libraries
Matplotlib: Base plotting library for Python

Seaborn: Statistical data visualization built on matplotlib

Plotly: Interactive plots for web-based visualization

Yellowbrick: ML-specific visualizations like confusion matrix, residual plots

SHAP & LIME: Model explainability visualizations

üß∞ Examples of Useful Plots
Histograms & KDE: Distribution of features

Boxplots: Detect outliers

Scatter plots: Feature relationships and clusters

Heatmaps: Correlation matrices

Confusion Matrix: Classification results

ROC Curve: Classifier performance at various thresholds

Learning Curves: Model training and validation error over epochs
