Spam_Email_Classifier notes
üìå What is Spam Email Classification?
Automated process to identify unwanted or harmful emails (spam) vs legitimate ones (ham)

Helps protect users from phishing, scams, and clutter

üîç How It Works
Use labeled datasets of emails (spam/ham)

Convert raw text into numerical features (text vectorization)

Train classification algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, deep learning)

Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

‚öôÔ∏è Key Steps
Data Collection: Common datasets ‚Äî Enron Spam, SpamAssassin, UCI SMS Spam

Data Cleaning: Remove noise (HTML tags, punctuation), lowercase, remove stopwords

Feature Extraction: Bag-of-words, TF-IDF, word embeddings (Word2Vec, BERT)

Model Training: Naive Bayes is a strong baseline for spam detection

Evaluation: Confusion matrix, precision/recall are critical to avoid false positives

üß∞ Common Challenges
Imbalanced datasets (spam usually minority)

Evolving spam tactics (concept drift)

Dealing with multi-lingual or obfuscated text
