Smart_Expense_Tracker_with_Anomaly_Detection notes
üìå What is a Smart Expense Tracker?
An application that helps users record and monitor their daily expenses

Categorizes spending and visualizes trends over time

Detects unusual or anomalous transactions that might indicate fraud, errors, or unexpected expenses

üîç How It Works
Data Input:

User inputs expense records (amount, category, date, description)

Data Storage & Aggregation:

Store expenses in a structured format (CSV, database)

Summarize by day, week, category

Anomaly Detection:

Use statistical or ML methods to identify outliers in spending

Methods: Z-score, Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, or Autoencoders

User Alerts:

Notify user of suspicious or unusually high expenses

Visualization:

Plot expense trends, category breakdown, anomalies

‚öôÔ∏è Typical Workflow
Collect expense data (can be sample/simulated)

Preprocess and encode categories

Train or apply anomaly detection model on amount or patterns

Build visualizations to show normal vs anomalous expenses

Provide actionable insights

üß∞ Common Tools & Libraries
Data handling: pandas, numpy

Anomaly detection: scikit-learn (IsolationForest, LocalOutlierFactor)

Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly

Optional UI: streamlit, flask
