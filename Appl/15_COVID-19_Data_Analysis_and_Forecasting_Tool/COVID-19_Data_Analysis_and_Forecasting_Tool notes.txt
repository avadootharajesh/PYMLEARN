COVID-19_Data_Analysis_and_Forecasting_Tool notes
üìå What is it?
A tool to analyze COVID-19 case data (confirmed, recovered, deaths) over time and forecast future trends

Helps public health officials and general users understand pandemic progression and prepare accordingly

üîç Core Components
Data Collection

Use publicly available datasets such as Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 dataset or WHO data

Data includes daily cases, deaths, recoveries by country or region

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handle missing values, smooth noisy data, convert date formats

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize trends: line charts, cumulative cases, daily new cases

Compare regions or countries

Calculate growth rates, moving averages

Forecasting

Use time series models like ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM to predict future case numbers

Evaluate forecast accuracy with RMSE, MAE

Visualization

Interactive plots with matplotlib, seaborn, or plotly

Dashboard-style interface for user-friendly analysis

‚öôÔ∏è Typical Workflow
Load and preprocess data

Perform EDA: visualize cases and trends

Train forecasting model on historical data

Predict future cases for next n days

Display visualizations and predictions

üß∞ Common Tools & Libraries
Data handling: pandas, numpy

Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly

Time series forecasting: statsmodels (ARIMA), fbprophet (Prophet), tensorflow/keras (LSTM)

Dashboard (optional): streamlit, dash
