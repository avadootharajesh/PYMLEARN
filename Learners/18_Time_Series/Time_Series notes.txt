# Time_Series notes.txt
üìå What is Time Series Data?
A sequence of data points indexed (or listed) in time order ‚Äî typically equally spaced time intervals like seconds, days, months.

üîç Characteristics
Temporal dependency: Past values influence future values

Trend: Long-term increase or decrease

Seasonality: Repeating patterns over fixed periods (daily, yearly)

Noise: Random variation or irregular fluctuations

Stationarity: Statistical properties (mean, variance) constant over time

‚öôÔ∏è Common Tasks in Time Series
| Task                    | Description                                | Techniques/Models                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Forecasting**         | Predict future values                      | ARIMA, SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, LSTM             |
| **Decomposition**       | Separate trend, seasonality, and residuals | STL, Classical decomposition                           |
| **Anomaly Detection**   | Detect unusual points                      | Statistical tests, Isolation Forest, LSTM Autoencoders |
| **Smoothing**           | Remove noise for clearer patterns          | Moving average, EWMA                                   |
| **Feature Engineering** | Extract features like lag, rolling mean    | Lag variables, rolling stats                           |
