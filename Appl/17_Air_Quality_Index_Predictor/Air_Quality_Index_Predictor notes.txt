Air_Quality_Index_Predictor notes
üìå What is AQI?
AQI (Air Quality Index) quantifies how polluted the air is, helping to communicate health risks from air pollution.

Common pollutants: PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, SO2, O3

AQI is calculated from pollutant concentration using standardized formulas

üîç What the AQI Predictor Does
Uses historical air quality and meteorological data to predict future AQI values

Helps individuals and authorities prepare and respond to poor air quality

Forecasting can be daily or hourly based on data granularity

‚öôÔ∏è Typical Workflow
Data Collection:

Gather historical AQI and pollutant concentration data from public sources (e.g., UCI Air Quality Dataset, EPA)

Include weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed) which influence AQI

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values, normalize data, create time features (hour, day, month)

Feature engineering for better model performance

Model Training:

Use regression models (Random Forest, XGBoost, or LSTM for time series)

Train on historical data to predict AQI values

Evaluation:

Metrics: RMSE, MAE, R¬≤

Visualize predictions vs actual values

Deployment:

Build an app or API for users to input features and get AQI predictions

üß∞ Common Tools & Libraries
Data handling: pandas, numpy

Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn

Models: scikit-learn (Random Forest, XGBoost), tensorflow/keras (LSTM)

Optional: streamlit or flask for UI
