Voice_Command_Recognition_App notes
üìå What is Voice Command Recognition?
System that processes spoken commands and translates them into actionable instructions

Used in smart assistants, IoT devices, accessibility tools

üîç How It Works
Audio Data Collection: Recordings of spoken commands

Preprocessing: Convert audio to spectrogram or MFCC features

Modeling: Train models like CNNs, RNNs, or transformers on audio features to classify commands

Recognition: Convert live audio or uploaded files to commands

Action Triggering: Perform actions based on recognized commands

‚öôÔ∏è Typical Workflow
Collect labeled audio dataset (commands and labels)

Extract features (MFCCs, Mel-spectrogram) using librosa

Train classifier (e.g., CNN with tensorflow or pytorch)

Deploy model to listen and classify incoming voice

üß∞ Common Tools & Libraries
Audio: librosa, soundfile

ML: tensorflow, keras, pytorch

Deployment: Flask or FastAPI for serving model

Recording: sounddevice or OS tools
