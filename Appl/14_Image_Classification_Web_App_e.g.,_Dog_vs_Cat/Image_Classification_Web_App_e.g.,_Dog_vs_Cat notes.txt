üìå What is Image Classification?
Assigning a label/category (e.g., dog or cat) to an input image based on its visual content

A fundamental problem in computer vision

üîç Dog vs Cat Classification Task
Classic binary image classification problem

Dataset example: Kaggle Dogs vs Cats dataset (~25k images)

Goal: Build a model that predicts whether an image contains a dog or a cat

‚öôÔ∏è Typical Workflow
Dataset Preparation: Download, label, and preprocess images (resize, normalize)

Model Selection: CNN architectures like VGG, ResNet, MobileNet for feature extraction

Training: Train model on labeled images, validate accuracy

Evaluation: Measure accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix

Web App: Allow users to upload an image and get instant prediction

üß∞ Common Tools & Libraries
Deep Learning: tensorflow, keras, pytorch

Image Processing: PIL, opencv-python

Web Frameworks: Streamlit, Flask

Utilities: numpy, matplotlib

üß† Model Notes
Use pretrained models (transfer learning) for faster and better results

Freeze convolutional layers, fine-tune final dense layers for binary classification

Input image size often 224x224 or 150x150
