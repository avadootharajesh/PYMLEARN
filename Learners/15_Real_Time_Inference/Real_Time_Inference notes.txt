# Real_Time_Inference notes.txt
üìå What is Real-Time Inference?
The process of using a trained machine learning model to make predictions immediately as new data arrives, typically via an API or streaming pipeline.

üîç Key Features
Low latency: Predictions must be fast (milliseconds to seconds)

High throughput: Can handle many requests per second

Scalable: Supports scaling horizontally/vertically to handle load

Robust & reliable: Handles failures gracefully

Stateless or Stateful: Usually stateless for scalability

‚öôÔ∏è Common Architectures
| Architecture         | Description                                    | Examples                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **REST API Serving** | Model exposed via web API endpoints            | Flask, FastAPI, TensorFlow Serving          |
| **gRPC Serving**     | High performance RPC communication             | TensorFlow Serving, Triton Inference Server |
| **Streaming**        | Data streams processed in real time            | Apache Kafka + Spark Streaming              |
| **Edge Inference**   | Model deployed on device for local inferencing | Mobile apps, IoT devices                    |
