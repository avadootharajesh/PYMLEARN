Movie_Recommendation_System notes
📌 What is a Movie Recommendation System?
A system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences or behavior

Helps users discover content tailored to their tastes

Enhances user engagement and satisfaction

🔍 Types of Recommendation Systems
Type	Description	Pros	Cons
Collaborative Filtering	Uses user-item interactions (ratings, views) to recommend similar items/users	No domain knowledge needed	Suffers from cold-start problems
Content-Based Filtering	Recommends movies similar to what the user liked based on movie features (genre, director)	Works well for new users	Limited to item features
Hybrid Systems	Combines collaborative and content-based methods	Leverages best of both	More complex to implement

⚙️ Typical Workflow
Data Collection: User ratings, movie metadata (genres, actors, directors), user profiles

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing data, encoding categorical features

Exploratory Data Analysis: Understand rating distributions, popular genres

Model Building:

Collaborative Filtering (Matrix Factorization, kNN)

Content-Based (TF-IDF, cosine similarity)

Hybrid approaches

Evaluation: RMSE, MAE, Precision@K, Recall@K, or ranking metrics like MAP, NDCG

Deployment: API or UI integration for personalized recommendations
