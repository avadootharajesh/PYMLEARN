üìå What is Problem Solving?
Systematic process to understand a problem, design a solution, implement it, and validate results ‚Äî all within the context of data and algorithms.

üîç Key Steps in Data Science Problem Solving
| Step                                 | Description                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Understand the Problem**        | Clarify the business or research objective, constraints, and deliverables. Ask: What‚Äôs the question? What success looks like? |
| **2. Data Collection & Exploration** | Gather relevant data, explore it, check quality, and understand features.                                                     |
| **3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** | Handle missing values, outliers, format issues, and transform data as needed.                                                 |
| **4. Feature Engineering**           | Create or select meaningful features that improve model learning.                                                             |
| **5. Model Selection & Training**    | Choose appropriate algorithms and train models using the prepared data.                                                       |
| **6. Evaluation**                    | Measure performance using relevant metrics and validate results thoroughly.                                                   |
| **7. Interpretation & Insights**     | Translate model output into actionable insights or decisions.                                                                 |
| **8. Deployment & Monitoring**       | Put the solution into production and monitor over time for accuracy and relevance.                                            |


üß† Problem-Solving Techniques & Tips
Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks

Use hypothesis-driven approach: Formulate assumptions, test with data

Apply iterative development: Build quick prototypes, improve step-by-step

Use visualizations to gain insights and validate assumptions

Always question data quality and biases

Document your approach and decisions for reproducibility

Collaborate and seek feedback from domain experts

üß∞ Tools to Aid Problem Solving
Jupyter notebooks for exploration and prototyping

Version control (Git) for tracking experiments

Automated testing for code reliability

Experiment tracking (MLflow, Weights & Biases)

Visualization libraries (matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly)
