Personalized_Diet_Recommendation_System notes
üìå What is a Personalized Diet Recommendation System?
A system that provides tailored diet plans based on an individual‚Äôs health profile, preferences, and goals

Helps users improve health outcomes such as weight loss, muscle gain, or managing medical conditions

Factors considered: age, gender, weight, height, activity level, dietary preferences/allergies, and health goals

üîç How It Works
User Profile Input:

Collect user details like age, gender, weight, height, activity level, and dietary restrictions/preferences

Calculate Nutritional Needs:

Compute Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)

Adjust calorie needs according to goals (weight loss, maintenance, gain)

Diet Plan Generation:

Recommend macro-nutrient distribution (carbs, proteins, fats) based on diet type (e.g., keto, balanced)

Suggest daily meal plans or food items aligned with calorie and macro targets

Personalization:

Customize recommendations based on preferences, allergies, and restrictions

Include tips, recipes, or food substitutions

Feedback Loop:

Users can update progress and refine recommendations

‚öôÔ∏è Typical Workflow
Gather user input (interactive form or API)

Calculate nutritional targets using formulas (Mifflin-St Jeor, Harris-Benedict)

Match food database items to meet macro and micronutrient goals

Generate and present diet recommendations

üß∞ Common Tools & Libraries
Data handling: pandas, numpy

User input: streamlit, flask

Nutrition databases: USDA FoodData Central API or custom food dataset

Optimization: simple rule-based or linear programming (scipy.optimize) for macro distribution
