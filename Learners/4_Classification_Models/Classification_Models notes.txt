📌 What is Classification?
Classification is a type of supervised learning where the goal is to predict the category or class of an observation based on input features.

🎯 Common Use Cases
Spam detection (spam / not spam)

Disease diagnosis (positive / negative)

Customer churn (churn / no churn)

Image classification (cat / dog / car / etc.)

🧠 Popular Classification Algorithms
Algorithm	Description
Logistic Regression	Linear model for binary classification
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)	Classifies based on closest points
Decision Tree	Splits data using feature thresholds
Random Forest	Ensemble of decision trees
Naive Bayes	Based on Bayes theorem with strong independence assumptions
Support Vector Machine (SVM)	Finds the optimal boundary (hyperplane) between classes
Gradient Boosting / XGBoost / LightGBM	Powerful ensemble models used in production

⚙️ Key Steps in Classification
Load and preprocess data

Split data into train and test sets

Choose model and train it

Make predictions

Evaluate performance

📈 Evaluation Metrics
Metric	Use
Accuracy	Overall correctness
Precision	Correct positives / all predicted positives
Recall (Sensitivity)	Correct positives / all actual positives
F1 Score	Harmonic mean of precision and recall
Confusion Matrix	Breakdown of TP, TN, FP, FN
ROC AUC Score	Trade-off between TPR and FPR

✅ Important Notes
Always scale features for SVM, KNN, and Logistic Regression.

Use StratifiedKFold for imbalanced classification.

Try multiple models and compare using cross-validation.
